# Robot Training Game

This is intended as a demonstration of **directed learning**,
a variation of reinforcement learning in which a human provides
all reward signals manually. It's rougly analagous to training a dog
to sit.

## Try it out

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brohrer/robot-training-game.git
cd robot-training-game
python3 play.py
```

It's developed on Linux and periodically tested on MacOS. I've tried
to keep it Windows compatible, but haven't tested it.
